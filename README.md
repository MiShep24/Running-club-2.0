# Running-club-2.0
Project of the ITMO University Running Club 2.0. The project was created to help with the assignment of points in physical education. The main thing is to aggregate information from your race posts from the Strava web app by posting a link on your personal page. Running data from the Strava app will be displayed on the user's personal page, and will also be automatically entered into the student's personal journal, where the student's score and total distance traveled will be calculated.

For install container use command (before that you should install docker):
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
For stopping and removing container use command:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
